# What is this?

Just the world's smallest, fully functional [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) IDE. It is written in [Flat Assembly](https://flatassembler.net/) and uses a bunch of [WinAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API) calls. Actually the only reason I used WinAPI are the requirements for the course project but who caresðŸ¤”.

The program can open, edit, save and run your Brainfuck code just like Xcode can hang your macOS for two minutes. More features might be added later (highlighting, sane programming languages etc.)
